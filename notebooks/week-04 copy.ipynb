    "Stephanie<sup>*</sup> @Evert2005 [54] defines μ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For μ > 1 we speak of positive association (where the components are more likely to occur together than if they were independent), and for μ < 1 we speak of negative association (where the components are less likely to occur together than if they were independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "She adds the following in a note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The letter μ is intended to be reminiscent of _mutual information_, since the quantity log(μ) can be interpreted as point-wise mutual information. I have avoided using this term for μ, though, so as not to confuse information theory with population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, μ says that f the ratio is greater than 1, the words co-appear more frequently than expected.\n",

    "We calculate μ by taking the ratio of the **observed** frequency (represented by O11 in a contingency table) and **expected** frequency (E11).\n",

This is a somewhat more complicated procedure than simply looking to the left and right of a word, and we'll need to account for it when we calculate the **random co-occurrence baseline**, the result of which is the **expected frequency of collocation**.\n",
    "\n",

    "Without any corrections, this method assumes that the tokens co-occur right next to each other (either before or after, but not both). To correct for the greater probability of the tokens co-occurring when we are not looking at immediate adjacency, we mutliply the numerator in this equation by the **window size**.\n",
